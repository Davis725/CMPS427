Let's talk about the structure!


<type>

Each specific equipment is a "type" For example, Iron Dagger is a different entry
    than Steel Dagger.


<name>Rusty Dagger</name>
    
The name is the actual displayed name of the equipment. Keep these unique
    and don't put spaces before or after, please! Only one name per equipment!
    
    
<slot>Main</slot>
    
The slot determines where the equipment gets equipped!
    The slots, as of this 2/9/14 are Main, Off, Head, Chest, Legs, Feet.
    You should only have one of these, unless you want to wear knifepants!
    
    
<attribute value="2">Power</attribute>

The attribute says the attribute that the equipment gives bonus (or penalty)
    to. The value is the amount of that bonus! You can have more than one of
    these!
